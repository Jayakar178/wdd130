          Stoicism teaches us to live according to nature, embrace the present moment, and distinguish what is within our control from what is not. These timeless principles remain deeply relevant in modern times. 
          Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, Seneca’s Letters, and Epictetus’ Discourses offer wisdom to navigate challenges with grace and intentionality.
